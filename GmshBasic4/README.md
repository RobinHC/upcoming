# Making Meshes for OpenFOAM with Gmsh, Part 4: Mesh Fields 
(Unstructured Boundary Layer)  

All code can be found at: 
https://github.com/rlee32/OpenFOAM_Tutorials/tree/master/GmshBasic4  

## Description
Here we will mesh an unstructured 2D airfoil with zone refinement near 
surfaces. We will learn how to gain more control of mesh refinement over 
regions away from the surface, as opposed to just at surfaces.  

## Outline
-Go over geometry and basic setup.  
-Go over in detail the specification of mesh field entities in Gmsh.  

## Software  
-Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit  
-OpenFOAM 3.0.0  
-Gmsh 2.11
